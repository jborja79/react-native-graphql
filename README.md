2. Clone this repo using `git@github.com:jborja79/react-native-graphql.git`

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default<br />
   *execute `react-native link react-native-gesture-handler` to avoid issues with RNGestureHandler<br />
   *At this point you can run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to see the app at emulator.*
